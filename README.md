# Using Data Visualization 

For this project we collected data through csvâ€™s, by using opensource software we visually represent data that we collected. Data visualization is an effective way to provide information to viewers, in a way that makes it easy to identify and recognize trends and patterns. Data visualization gives the viewer a clear idea of the information that is being expressed, in a relatively shorter and easier mental format to digest.

# The Issue 
While social and civil unrest have become a normal occurrence in the nation, deep flaws and divides over policing have been shoved into the spotlight. But the financial impact that these social issues has caused, has not seemed to receive the same lighting.

Making data visualization more effective than looking through hundreds and even thousands of rows on a spreadsheet.

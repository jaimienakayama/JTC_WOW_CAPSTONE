# This folder contains a bug that we ran into when creating the per capita graph

It includes:

1. final.csv : The csv used to get amount awarded data
2. population_data.csv : The csv used to get population data

---

3. per capita.ipynb : When plotting this graph, we discovered a bug in the per capita graph which has Los Angeles as an outlier. When re-checking the data, we found that this was incorrect. After correcting the data, we plotted the correct per capita graph. You can view the corrected per capita graph listed outside this directory.
